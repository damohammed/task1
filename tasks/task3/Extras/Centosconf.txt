For installing nginx on centos, I have written script commands to centos installer terraform file.

Firstly I have installed needed package repo.

After that I have updated centos repository with:
 sudo yum update

and then it had got nginx on its repository
So after that I installed nginx with:
Sudo yum install nginx

Then I printed hello world to index file with redirecting:
echo "hello world" >> /var/www/html/index.html
