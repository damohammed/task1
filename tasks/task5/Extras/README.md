<h1>TASK 1</h1>

For task 1 I have already installed docker, so not intsalled again.

Then I have written yml files in order to install linux distro, nginx web server, mysql-server and php language(LEMP) as containers in docker

nginx and mysql requires ports in order to run. So I have give my local port 8080 to run in port 80 of nginx

and port 9090 to run in port 3306 which is mysql default port
